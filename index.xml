As this is a forensics challenge, I started off by opening the image file in Autopsy. Once everything has loaded, we were able to see that there is a file of interest, an ELF binary,under the &amp;lsquo;Deleted Files&amp;rsquo; category.
In order to perform further investigation, the ELF binary was extracted from the filesystem image.</description></item></channel></rss>
