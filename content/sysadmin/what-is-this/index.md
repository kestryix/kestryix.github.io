Hello! I see you have found my sysadmin dump

Most of what you would find here are probably my documentation/configurations tested on Debian 10/11 and Windows Server 2019 from maybe 4 to 5 years ago... Maybe the occasional cisco config dump :D

I recorded most of these for my own learning when I was exploring setting up 
networks, services and service integration. I hope to be able to work on these again some day!
