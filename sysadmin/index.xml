I see you have found my sysadmin dump&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Most of what you would find here are probably my documentation/configurations tested on Debian 10/11 and Windows Server 2019 from maybe 4 to 5 years ago&amp;hellip; Maybe the occasional cisco config dump :D&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I recorded most of these for my own learning when I was exploring setting up
networks, services and service integration. I hope to be able to work on these again some day!&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
