I am currently a second year student studying Information Security at NUS.

This blog acts as a sort of a learning dump/brain dump for me for all the things that I have learnt so far! I hope to be able to keep track of my learning here so that it is not all over the place (and in my random external drives)

*I am currently still slowly populating my blog as 17 year old me decided it was a good idea to store all my documentation in MS Word documents...*
